# Inbound Adapter Definition
ADAPTER_IN_LABEL=FlexText Inbound Adapter
ADAPTER_IN_DESC=Release ${project.release}: This adapter is capable of receiving delimited text data in CSV (or similar) format. Use the Text Inbound Adapter when consuming data from a text-based source. This adapter provides additional flexibility when receiving messages of variable length but always of the same definition.  Fields from the text will be assigned to event fields in the order they are received. If there are too many fields in the text message, the extras will be ignored. If there are not enough fields in the text message, the remaining fields in the event will be set to null. <p><b>Troubleshooting:</b><br>Loggers that can help troubleshoot: <ul><li>com.esri.geoevent.adapter.flextext.TextInboundAdapterService</li><li>com.esri.geoevent.adapter.flextext.TextInboundAdapter</li></ul><p><i>This adapter is compatible with GeoEvent ${project.version} or later (the version of this adapter does not have to match the version of your GeoEvent Server).</i>
CREATE_NEW_UNRECOGNIZED_GED_LBL=Create Unrecognized Event Definitions
CREATE_NEW_UNRECOGNIZED_GED_DESC=Determines if the adapter will create a new GeoEvent Definition for event records whose first attribute field value does not correspond with an existing GeoEvent Definition of the same name in ArcGIS GeoEvent Server.
MESSAGE_SEPERATOR_LBL=Event Separator
MESSAGE_SEPERATOR_DESC=Enter the literal characters, comma (,) semi (;) or forward-slash (/) for example, used as event delimiters in your input data stream. This is what distinguishes on event record from another. Specify \\n for a line feed, \\r for a carriage return, and \\t for a tab character. Unicode values are supported such as \\u0020 for an ASCII space. Multiple character delimiters are also supported such as \\u0020\\u0020 if two consecutive ASCII space characters together are to be considered a single field delimiter.
ATTRIBUTE_SEPERATOR_LBL=Field Separator
ATTRIBUTE_SEPERATOR_DESC=Enter the literal character used as a field delimiter in your input data stream. This is what distinguishes the fields in an event record. For example:  comma (,) semi-colon (;) or forward-slash (/). Java escape sequences for new-line (\\n) and tab (\\t) are supported, as are Unicode values. Examples of Unicode values are \\u003B (;) and \\u0009 (tab).
INCOMING_DATA_CONTAINS_GED_LBL=Incoming Data Contains GeoEvent Definition
INCOMING_DATA_CONTAINS_GED_DESC=When this property is set to No, all incoming data is assumed to be in the same format or schema. The first attribute field in the event record is not the name of a GeoEvent Definition. A new or existing GeoEvent Definition will need to be defined to process GeoEvents sharing one schema.<br>    <br>When this property is set to Yes, the first attribute field of each event record received is assumed to be the name of a GeoEvent Definition. If the name of the first attribute field matches an existing GeoEvent Definition name and schema, the adapter will use that GeoEvent Definition to process the event record as a GeoEvent. If the name of the first attribute field does not match an existing GeoEvent Definition of the same name and schema, the event record will not be processed.
CREATE_NEW_GED_LBL=Create GeoEvent Definition
CREATE_NEW_GED_DESC=Determines if the Inbound Text Adapter will create a new GeoEvent Definition that is derived from the schema of the first incoming event.
NEW_GED_NAME_LBL=GeoEvent Definition Name (New)
NEW_GED_NAME_DESC=When the adapter receives the first event, it will create a GeoEvent Definition with this name.  The first incoming event will be used to determine the structure (or schema) of the new GeoEvent Definition.
EXISTING_GED_NAME_LBL=GeoEvent Definition Name (Existing)
EXISTING_GED_NAME_DESC=Select the GeoEvent Definition whose schema will be used to create a GeoEvent.  
BUILD_GEOMETRY_LBL=Construct Geometry from Fields
BUILD_GEOMETRY_DESC=Determines if the adapter should use separate fields in the event data to build a point geometry.  If you expect the coordinate values of each event record to come in as separate fields, make sure this property is set.
X_GEOM_FIELD_LBL=X Geometry Field
X_GEOM_FIELD_DESC=The name of the field that has the X (or horizontal, or longitude) part of the point geometry.
Y_GEOM_FIELD_LBL=Y Geometry Field
Y_GEOM_FIELD_DESC=The name of the field that has the Y (or vertical, or latitude) part of the point geometry.
Z_GEOM_FIELD_LBL=Z Geometry Field
Z_GEOM_FIELD_DESC=The name of the field that has the Z (or depth, or altitude) part of the point geometry.  This is optional.  If blank, the z value will be omitted from the point geometry.
SPATIAL_REFERENCE_FIELD_LBL=Default Spatial Reference
SPATIAL_REFERENCE_FIELD_DESC=Specify the default WKID or WKT for geometries that do not contain a spatial reference.  Or the field that contains the WKID or WKT in each event.
CUSTOM_DATE_FORMAT_LBL=Expected Date Format
CUSTOM_DATE_FORMAT_DESC=The adapter will use this date format to parse incoming date strings as dates. The Date Format is specified using standard Java conventions:<br>  y - Year.<br>  M - Month in year.<br>  d - Day in month.<br>  H - Hour in day (0-23).<br>  h - Hour in am/pm (1-12).<br>  m - Minute in hour.<br>  s - Second in minute.<br>  S - Millisecond.<br>  z - Time zone (General time zone).<br>  Z - Time zone (RFC 822 time zone).<br>  X - Time zone (ISO 8601 time zone).<br>  a - am/pm marker.<br>  G - Era designator (AD).<br>  w - Week in year.<br>  W - Week in month.<br>  D - Day in year.<br>  F - Day of week in month.<br>  E - Day in week.<br>  k - Hour in day (1-24).<br>  K - Hour in am/pm (0-11).<br>  Y - Week year (2009, 09).<br>  u - Day number of week (1=Monday,...,7-Sunday).<br>  <br>  Examples:<br>  <br>A datetime value of 12-30-2019 would need to be specified as MM-dd-yyyy.<br>  <br>A datetime value of Mar 21 2019 14:25:30 GMT would need to be specified as MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss zzz.<br>
LOCALE_FOR_NUMBER_FORMATTER_LBL=Language for Number Formatting
LOCALE_FOR_NUMBER_FORMATTER_DESC=Enter a locale (Locale ID) used to format numbers for the incoming data. The default is your machine's locale. See (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javase7locales-334809.html) for more information about locales.

#Connector definition
INPUT_TCP_CONNNECTOR_LABEL=Receive Flex Text from a TCP Socket
INPUT_TCP_CONNNECTOR_DESC=Receives flexible text via a TCP socket and converts it to GeoEvents. If the text line contains fewer fields than the geoevent definition, the extra fields in the geoevent will be set to null. If the text line contains more fields than the geoevent definition, the extra text fields will be ignored.<p>Can be used to receive simulated events from the GeoEvent Simulator.
INPUT_FILE_CONNNECTOR_LABEL=Watch a Folder for New Flex CSV Files
INPUT_FILE_CONNNECTOR_DESC=Reads flexible CSV files from a folder data store and converts data to GeoEvents. If the CSV line contains fewer fields than the geoevent definition, the extra fields in the geoevent will be set to null.
